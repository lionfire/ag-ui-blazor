// # Project Settings
// This file should be placed at {project_root}/.ax/coding-agents.hjson

// Scales are from 0.0 (none) to 1.0 (max) unless otherwise specified.

// ## Resourcing
resourcing: {
  implementation-speed: 1.0  // how quickly I want this project to be completed.
}


// ## Thoroughness
// Thoroughness relates to completeness of:
// - security analysis
// - unit tests
// - e2e tests
// - code reviews
// - any other forms of production readiness
thoroughness: { // Scale from 0 (none) to 1 (max)
  // How much thoroughness do you **currently** want for this project?
  current: 0.2
  // How much thoroughness do you **eventually** want for this project?
  eventual: 1.0
}
//   - (If this is low but I eventually want high thoroughness, it could be because I want to make a tool for myself that I might want to make publicly available someday.  Or it could just be an experimental prototype that I may want to turn into a product if I like the prototype.)
// - (If both are high, it is likely that I have a product for public use in mind, and want to get it production-ready ASAP)
